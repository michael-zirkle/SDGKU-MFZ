        <h1 style="font-family:cursive"> A little Bit About Me </h1><hr>
        <p style="color:blue"> I served in the Marines and am currently working at
            a textile mill where we make yarn for carpet. Not
            exactly the most extravagent of occupations. Hence
            my participation in this program.   
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-family:Cambria"> My Hobbies </h2><br>
        <p style="color:red"> I don't have many to speak of. Mostly my time 
            is spent either working or running errands and taking
            care of my family. Although when I do find the time
            I enjoy playing guitar (all be it poorly) and playing
            games with my son. Although hopefully in the near
            future my hobbies will consist of coding.
